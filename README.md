# Project Overview: E-Commerce Application (MERN Stack )

This project will guide you through building  full-stack E-commerce website  using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to browse products, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout. Admin users can manage products, view orders, and update inventory.

## Tech Stack

- *Frontend:* React.js, Redux, React Router
- *Backend:* Node.js, Express.js
- *Database:* MongoDB
- *Authentication:* JWT (JSON Web Tokens), bcryptjs
- *Payment Gateway:* Stripe
- *State Management:* Redux for managing app state
- *Deployment:* Heroku (or any cloud provider like AWS)

## Key Features

- *User Authentication:* 
  - Register, login, and logout functionality with secure password storage using bcryptjs.
  - JWT-based authentication to manage sessions.
  
- *Product Management:*
  - Display products with sorting and filtering options based on categories, price, ratings, etc.
  - Admin panel to add, update, or delete products.

- *Shopping Cart:*
  - Add products to the cart, view cart details, and update item quantities.
  - Display total prices and calculate shipping fees.

- *Checkout Process:*
  - Integration with Stripe for secure payment processing.
  - Users can review their order and proceed with payment.

- *Order Management:*
  - Users can view their order history and track current orders.
  - Admin can update order status (Pending, Shipped, Delivered).

- *Responsive Design:*
  - Fully responsive UI to support different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

- *Search and Filter:*
  - Search products by name and filter by categories, price range, and ratings.

- *Security Features:*
  - Input validation and data sanitization.
  - HTTPS support for secure data transmission.



# Milestone 1: 

In a MERN stack application, login and sign-up (authentication) typically involve a process where users can register (sign-up) with their credentials, and later log in using those credentials. The login and sign-up process can be divided into several steps, with separate client-side (React) and server-side (Node.js/Express) handling.

# Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page

This milestone focuses on setting up the project and building the **Login Page** using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. The login page includes user authentication fields and responsive design elements.

# What Was Achieved?
- Project Initialization: Set up the React environment and GitHub repository.
- Built the Login Page:
  - Email and password input fields.
  - "Remember Me" checkbox.
  - "Forgot Password?" link.
  - Submit button with basic validation.
- Styled using Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive look.
- Updated README to document project progress.

# Technologies Used
- React (Functional Components & Hooks)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
